# README
This repo helps build a simple iPXE CD to drop into the iPXE shell on boot.  The iPXE shell will not invoke any DHCP requests unless by the `dhcp` command.  This iPXE shell is a perfect landing area for Packer to type boot commands, which can invoke DHCP and chain an templated iPXE script from a webserver.
